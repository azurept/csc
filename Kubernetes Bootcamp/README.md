# This is a step-by-step guide on How to setup a Kubernetes Bootcamp

1. **Meet with the customer**  

    Use the presentation "[KB] Customer Facing Deck" to present the bootcamp, its timeline and the friday workshops and talks (if you choose to do it).
    
    In case you opt to have friday sessions, you should, by this point, have the speakers already defined (it can be you, a partner, a GBB, it is totally up to you). As a suggestion, in the folder "Session PPT" you will find the presentations used in each week on a previous Bootcamp.
    
    To take the challenge to another level, you can engage with your local PMMs to have a swag kit to  give to the winners.
    

2. **Create the Challenge**  

    Go to: https://cloudskillschallenge.docs.microsoft.com/csc/create

    - This challenge requires participants to accept ‘Official Rules’ to join: **No**  
    - Challenge type: **Collection**  
    - Primary subject matter: **Azure Apps & Infrastructure**  
    - Pre-made collection or provide collection URL: **Provide collection URL**

    - Solo or Teams: **Solo**  
    - Participant type: **Event**  
    - Allow participants to opt-in to the Microsoft.Source developer community newsletter during challenge registration: **Yes**  
    - Let us know if this is a real or a test challenge: **This is real**  
  
3. **Send the Invites for the Bootcamp**  

    Use the email template "Kubernetes Bootcamp - Convite!" to present and invite people to this Bootcamp. There should be a main point of contact (preferebly a sponsor) within the customer, to help you spread this invites.  
    
    Before sending this invite, you should save the "Join the Challenge!" meeting request as an iCallender format as a reminder for all the participants to enter the competition (since it is only possible to join in on the first day of the competition, so make sure you edit the meeting request with a small duration like 15 min so it doesn't look like a blocker, and set it to the first day of the competition).  
    
    The meeting request should be attached to the "Kubernetes Bootcamp - Convite!" email so that, when the participants follow the instructions given on the email and add the meeting to their callendar, you will have access to their emails for your weekly communications. **(VER RGPD E SE PODEMOS FAZER LANDING PAGE COMO NUM EVENTO)** 

4. **Follow up with the participants on a weekly basis**

    We've prepared in advance 4 email templates that should be send in each respective week. This emails aim to remind every participant to complete the recommended modules, and to attend the friday sessions. Due to the nature of this emails, we recommend that they are send towards the end of each week and before the friday sessions so Thursday mornings should work out nicely.
