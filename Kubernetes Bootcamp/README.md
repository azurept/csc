# This is a step-by-step guide on How to setup a Kubernetes Bootcamp

1. **Meet with the customer**  
    Use the presentation "[KB] Customer Facing Deck" to present the bootcamp, its timeline and if you choose to do them, the friday workshops and talks.

2. **Create the Challenge**  

    Go to: https://cloudskillschallenge.docs.microsoft.com/csc/create

    - Challenge type: **Collection**  
    - Primary subject matter: **Azure Apps & Infrastructure**

3. **Send the Invites for the Bootcamp**  
    Use the email template "Kubernetes Bootcamp - Convite!" to present and invite people to this Bootcamp. Ther should be a main point of contact within the customer, to help you spread this invites.  
    
    Before sending this invite, you should save the "Join the Challenge!" meeting request as an iCallender format as a reminder for all the participants to enter the competition (since it is only possible to join in on the first day of the competition, so make sure you edit the meeting request with the a small duration like 15 min so it doesn't look like a blocker, and set it to the first day of the competition).  
    
    The meeting request should be attached to the "Kubernetes Bootcamp - Convite!" email so that, when the participants follow the instructions given on the email and add the meeting to their callendar, you will have access to their emails for your weekly communications. **(VER RGPD E SE PODEMOS FAZER LANDING PAGE COMO NUM EVENTO)**
